I am a first-year Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) (UofT), and I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Kuldeep Meel](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/). Prior to Ph.D., I also finished my Bachelor of Science degree at UofT.

My research intersects machine learning and formal methods, with a specialized focus on advancing automated symbolic reasoning through machine learning techniques. In
particular, I aim to empower computers with the ability to perform mathematical reasoning and theorem proving within the realms of logic and mathematics.
